/**
 * A year with 366 days is called a leap year. Leap years are necessary to keep the cal-
 * endar synchronized with the sun because the earth revolves around the sun once
 * every 365.25 days. Actually, that figure is not entirely precise, and for all dates after
 * 1582 the Gregorian correction applies. Usually years that are divisible by 4 are leap
 * years, for example 1996. However, years that are divisible by 100 (for example, 1900)
 * are not leap years, but years that are divisible by 400 are leap years (for example,
 * 2000). Write a program that asks the user for a year and computes whether that year
 * is a leap year. Provide a class Year with a method isLeapYear. Use a single if statement
 * and Boolean operators.
